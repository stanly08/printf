This is a colaboratory project of 2 on printf

So each member should contribute and push atleast 40% of the total project to the repo.
The printf function is a very important and versatile function in the C programming language and being about to create your custom version of it will go a long way to enhance your understanding of the language.

The first secret to being able to complete this project successfully is to first get a solid understanding of the printf function itself, how it works and all the different ways in which it can be used.

This concept page will therefore give you a detailed explanation of how the printf function works and that will go a long way to help you understand what it takes to create a custom version of it.

In this project we will be able to cover the areas below;
a)A brief introduction to printf.
b)Argument handling - you have to have a better understanding of variadic functions.
c)Understand format specifiers.
d)Final output of the printf.
e)Error handling, memory management, testing and debugging.
